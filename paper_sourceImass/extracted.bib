                   imaging of the 28SiO v = 1 and v = 2, J = 1-0 maser
                   emission toward the massive young stellar object
                   (YSO) Orion Source I. Both SiO transitions were
                   observed simultaneously with an angular resolution of
                   ~0.5 mas (~0.2 AU for d = 414 pc) and a spectral
                   resolution of ~0.2 km s-1. Here we explore the global
                   properties and kinematics of the emission through two
                   19-epoch animated movies spanning 21 months (from
                   2001 March 19 to 2002 December 10). These movies
                   provide the most detailed view to date of the
                   dynamics and temporal evolution of molecular material
                   within ~20-100 AU of a massive (gsim8 M sun) YSO. As
                   in previous studies, we find that the bulk of the SiO
                   masers surrounding Source I lie in an X-shaped locus;
                   the emission in the south and east arms is
                   predominantly blueshifted, and emission in the north
                   and west is predominantly redshifted. In addition,
                   bridges of intermediate-velocity emission are
                   observed connecting the red and blue sides of the
                   emission distribution. We have measured proper
                   motions of over 1000 individual maser features and
                   found that these motions are characterized by a
                   combination of radially outward migrations along the
                   four main maser-emitting arms and motions tangent to
                   the intermediate-velocity bridges. We interpret the
                   SiO masers as arising from a wide-angle bipolar wind
                   emanating from a rotating, edge-on disk. The
                   detection of maser features along extended, curved
                   filaments suggests that magnetic fields may play a
                   role in launching and/or shaping the wind. Our
                   observations appear to support a picture in which
                   stars with masses as high as at least 8 M sun form
                   via disk-mediated accretion. However, we cannot yet
                   rule out that the Source I disk may have been formed
                   or altered following a recent close encounter.},

                   Array (ALMA) observations of a circumstellar disk
                   around Source I in Orion KL, an archetype of massive
                   protostar candidates. We detected two ortho-H2O lines
                   at 321 GHz (102, 9-93, 6) and 336 GHz (nu2 = 1, 52,
                   3-61, 6) for the first time in Source I. The latter
                   one is in a vibrationally excited state at the lower
                   state energy of 2939 K, suggesting evidence of hot
                   molecular gas close to Source I. The integrated
                   intensity map of the 321 GHz line is elongated along
                   the bipolar outflow while the 336 GHz line map is
                   unresolved with a beam size of 0.''4. Both of these
                   maps show velocity gradients perpendicular to the
                   bipolar outflow. The velocity centroid map of the 321
                   GHz line implies a spatial and velocity structure
                   similar to that of vibrationally excited SiO masers
                   tracing the root of the outflow emanating from the
                   disk surface. In contrast, the 336 GHz line is most
                   likely emitting from the disk midplane with a
                   diameter of 0.''2 (84 AU) as traced by radio
                   continuum emission and a dark lane devoid of the
                   vibrationally excited SiO maser emission. The
                   observed velocity gradient and the spectral profile
                   of the 336 GHz H2O line can be reconciled with a
                   model of an edge-on ring-like structure with an
                   enclosed mass of >7 M &sun; and an excitation
                   temperature of >3000 K. The present results provide
                   further evidence of a hot and neutral circumstellar
                   disk rotating around Source I with a diameter of ~100

  abstract =      {Orion Source I ('SrcI') is the protostar at the
                   center of the Kleinmann-Low Nebula. ALMA observations
                   of SrcI at 350 and 660 GHz failed to detect the
                   H26$\alpha$ and H21$\alpha$ recombination lines,
                   ruling out the possibility that SrcI is a
                   hypercompact HII region. The deconvolved size of the
                   continuum source is approximately 0.23 x 0.05" (100 x
                   20 AU); it is interpreted as a disk viewed almost
                   edge-on. The continuum flux density is proportional
                   to $\nu^2$ from 43 GHz to 350 GHz, then increases
                   slightly faster than $\nu^2$ from 350 GHz to 660 GHz.
                   Optically thick thermal emission from ~500 K dust is
                   the most plausible source of the continuum, even at
                   frequencies as low as 43 GHz; the disk mass is most
                   likely in the range 0.02-0.2 Mo. A rich spectrum of
                   molecular lines is detected, mostly from sulfur- and
                   silicon-rich molecules like SO, SO$_2$, and SiS, but
                   also including vibrationally excited CO and several
                   unidentified transitions. Lines with upper energy
                   levels E$_U$ > 500 K appear in emission and are
                   symmetric about the source's LSR velocity of 5
                   km/sec, while lines with E$_U$ < 500 K appear as
                   blueshifted absorption features against the
                   continuum, indicating that they originate in
                   outflowing gas. The emission lines exhibit a velocity
                   gradient along the major axis of the disk that is
                   consistent with rotation around a 5-7 Mo central
                   object. The relatively low mass of SrcI and the
                   existence of a 100 AU disk around it are incompatible
                   with the model in which SrcI and the nearby
                   Becklin-Neugebauer Object were ejected from a
                   multiple system 500 years ago.},

  abstract =      {We have measured astrometry for members of the Orion
                   Nebula Cluster with images obtained in 2015 with the
                   Wide Field Camera 3 on board the Hubble Space
                   Telescope. By comparing those data to previous
                   measurements with NICMOS on Hubble in 1998, we have
                   discovered that a star in the Kleinmann-Low Nebula,
                   source x from Lonsdale et al. (1982), is moving with
                   an unusually high proper motion of 29 mas/yr, which
                   corresponds to 55 km/s at the distance of Orion.
                   Previous radio observations have found that three
                   other stars in the Kleinmann-Low Nebula (BN and
                   sources I and n) have high proper motions (5-14
                   mas/yr) and were near a single location ~540 years
                   ago, and thus may have been members of a multiple
                   system that dynamically decayed. The proper motion of
                   source x is consistent with ejection from that same
                   location 540 years ago, which provides strong
                   evidence that the dynamical decay did occur and that
                   the runaway star BN originated in the Kleinmann-Low
                   Nebula rather than the nearby Trapezium cluster.
                   However, our constraint on the motion of source n is
                   significantly smaller than the most recent radio
                   measurement, which indicates that it did not
                   participate in the event that ejected the other three
                   stars.},

                   for massive star formation are explored and
                   contrasted with the gradual accumulation of mass by
                   accretion. In high-density protostar clusters,
                   envelopes and disks provide a viscous medium that can
                   dissipate the kinetic energy of passing stars,
                   greatly enhancing the probability of capture.
                   Protostellar mergers may produce high-luminosity
                   infrared flares lasting years to centuries followed
                   by a luminosity decline on the Kelvin-Helmholtz
                   timescale of the merger product. Mergers may be
                   surrounded by thick tori of expanding debris,
                   impulsive wide-angle outflows, and shock-induced
                   maser and radio continuum emission. Collision
                   products are expected to have fast stellar rotation
                   and a large multiplicity fraction. Close encounters
                   or mergers will produce circumstellar debris disks
                   with an orientation that differs from that of a
                   preexisting disk. Thus, massive stars growing by a
                   series of mergers may produce eruptive outflows with
                   random orientations; the walls of the resulting
                   outflow cavities may be observable as filaments of
                   dense gas and dust pointing away from the massive
                   star. The extremely rare merger of two stars close to
                   the upper-mass end of the initial mass function may
                   be a possible pathway to hypernova-generated
                   gamma-ray bursts. In contrast with the violence of
                   merging, the gradual growth of massive stars by
                   accretion is likely to produce less infrared
                   variability, relatively thin circumstellar accretion
                   disks that maintain their orientation, and collimated
                   bipolar outflows that are scaled-up versions of those
                   produced by low-mass young stellar objects. While
                   such accretional growth can lead to the formation of
                   massive stars in isolation or in loose clusters,
                   mergers can only occur in high-density cluster
                   environments. It is proposed that the outflow
                   emerging from the OMC-1 core in the Orion molecular
                   cloud was produced by a protostellar merger that
                   released between 1048 and 1049 ergs less than a
                   thousand years ago.},

                   emission from the young stellar objects radio Source
                   I and BN at several epochs. Radio Source I is highly
                   elongated northwest-southeast, and remarkably stable
                   in flux density, position angle, and overall
                   morphology over nearly a decade. This favors the
                   extended emission component arising from an ionized
                   edge-on disk rather than an outwardly propagating
                   jet. We have measured the proper motions of Source I
                   and BN for the first time at 43 GHz. We confirm that
                   both sources are moving at high speed (12 and 26 km
                   s-1, respectively) approximately in opposite
                   directions, as previously inferred from measurements
                   at lower frequencies. We discuss dynamical scenarios
                   that can explain the large motions of both BN and
                   Source I and the presence of disks around both. Our
                   new measurements support the hypothesis that a close
                   (~50 AU) dynamical interaction occurred around 500
                   years ago between Source I and BN as proposed by
                   Gomez et al. From the dynamics of encounter, we argue
                   that Source I today is likely to be a binary with a
                   total mass on the order of 20 M sun and that it
                   probably existed as a softer binary before the close
                   encounter. This enables preservation of the original
                   accretion disk, though truncated to its present
                   radius of ~50 AU. N-body numerical simulations show
                   that the dynamical interaction between a binary of 20
                   M sun total mass (Source I) and a single star of 10 M
                   sun mass (BN) may lead to the ejection of both and
                   binary hardening. The gravitational energy released
                   in the process would be large enough to power the
                   wide-angle, high-velocity flow traced by H2 and CO
                   emission in the BN/KL nebula. Assuming that the
                   proposed dynamical history is correct, the smaller
                   mass for Source I recently estimated from SiO maser
                   dynamics (gsim7 M sun) by Matthews et al., suggests
                   that non-gravitational forces (e.g., magnetic) must
                   play an important role in the circumstellar gas
                   dynamics.},

                   ongoing high-mass star formation. Recent proper
                   motion observations provide convincing evidence of a
                   recent (about 500 years ago) dynamical interaction
                   between two massive young stellar objects (YSOs) in
                   the region resulting in high velocities: the BN
                   object and radio Source I. At the same time, Source I
                   is surrounded by a nearly edge-on disc with radius
                   ˜50 au. These two observations taken together are
                   puzzling: a dynamical encounter between multiple
                   stars naturally yields the proper motions, but the
                   survival of a disc is challenging to explain. In this
                   paper we take the first steps to numerically explore
                   the preferred dynamical scenario of Goddi et al., in
                   which Source I is a binary that underwent a
                   scattering encounter with BN, in order to determine
                   if a pre-existing disc can survive this encounter in
                   some form. Treating only gravitational forces, we are
                   able to thoroughly and efficiently cover a large
                   range of encounter parameters. We find that disc
                   material can indeed survive a three-body scattering
                   event if (1) the encounter is close, i.e. BN's
                   closest approach to Source I is comparable to Source
                   I's semimajor axis and (2) the interplay of the three
                   stars is of a short duration. Furthermore, we are
                   able to constrain the initial conditions that can
                   broadly produce the orientation of the present-day
                   system's disc relative to its velocity vector. To
                   first order we can thus confirm the plausibility of
                   the scattering scenario of Goddi et al., and we have
                   significantly constrained the parameters and narrowed
                   the focus of future, more complex and expensive
                   attempts to computationally model the complicated
                   BN/KL region.},

                   (KL) outflow emerging from OMC1 behind the Orion
                   Nebula may have been powered by the dynamical decay
                   of a non-hierarchical multiple system ~500 years ago
                   that ejected the massive stars I, BN, and source n,
                   with velocities of about 10-30 km s-1. New
                   proper-motion measurements of H2 features show that
                   within the errors of measurement, the outflow
                   originated from the site of stellar ejection.
                   Combined with published data, these measurements
                   indicate an outflow age of ~500 years, similar to the
                   time since stellar ejection. The total kinetic energy
                   of the ejected stars and the outflow is about 2 to 6
                   {\~A}--- 1047 erg. It is proposed that the
                   gravitational potential energy released by the
                   formation of a short-period binary, most likely
                   source I, resulted in stellar ejection and powered
                   the outflow. A scenario is presented for the
                   formation of a compact, non-hierarchical multiple
                   star system, its decay into an ejected binary and two
                   high-velocity stars, and launch of the outflow. Three
                   mechanisms may have contributed to the explosion in
                   the gas: (1) unbinding of the circumcluster envelope
                   following stellar ejection, (2) disruption of
                   circumstellar disks and high-speed expulsion of the
                   resulting debris during the final stellar encounter,
                   and (3) the release of stored magnetic energy.
                   Plausible protostellar disk end envelope properties
                   can produce the observed outflow mass, velocity, and
                   kinetic energy distributions. The ejected stars may
                   have acquired new disks by fall-back or Bondi-Hoyle
                   accretion with axes roughly orthogonal to their
                   velocities. The expulsion of gas and stars from OMC1
                   may have been driven by stellar interactions.},

                   dynamical decay of a non-hierarchical system of
                   massive stars. Methods: Narrow-band H2, [Fe ii], and
                   broad-band Ks obtained with the Gemini South
                   multi-conjugate AO system GeMS and near-IR imager
                   GSAOI are presented. The images reach resolutions of

                   of the 8-m telescope at 2.12 mum. Comparison with
                   previous AO-assisted observations of sub-fields and

                   of proper motions and the investigation of

                   numerical simulations of compact, high-density clumps
                   moving ~103 times their own diameter through a lower
                   density medium at Mach 103. Results: Several
                   sub-arcsecond H2 features and many [Fe ii]
                   "fingertips" on the projected outskirts of the flow
                   show proper motions of ~300 km s-1. High-velocity,
                   sub-arcsecond H2 knots ("bullets") are seen as far as
                   140'' from their suspected ejection site. If these
                   knots propagated through the dense Orion A cloud,
                   their survival sets a lower bound on their densities
                   of order 107 cm-3, consistent with an origin within a
                   few au of a massive star and accelerated by a final
                   multi-body dynamic encounter that ejected the BN
                   object and radio source I from OMC1 about 500 yr ago.
                   Conclusions: Over 120 high-velocity bow-shocks
                   propagating in nearly all directions from the OMC1
                   cloud core provide evidence for an explosive origin
                   for the BN/KL outflow triggered by the dynamic decay
                   of a non-hierarchical system of massive stars. Such

                   generated an explosion in the gas. New ALMA

                   spherically symmetric distribution of over a hundred

                   velocities increase (or decrease) linearly with
                   projected distance from the explosion center, forming
                   a ``Hubble Flow'' confined to within 50" of the

                   event may have been powered by the release of
                   gravitational potential energy associated with the
                   formation of a compact binary or a protostellar
                   merger. Orion may be the prototype for a new class of

                   among the ONC's ~1000 members are: theta1 Ori C, the
                   most massive binary in the cluster with stars of

                   the Kleinmann-Low (KL) nebula protostar, a highly
                   obscured, ~15 M &sun; object still accreting gas
                   while also driving a powerful, apparently "explosive"

                   debated: How did BN acquire its high velocity? How is
                   this related to massive star formation in the KL
                   nebula? Here, we report the results of a systematic
                   survey using ~107 numerical experiments of
                   gravitational interactions of the theta1C and BN
                   stars. We show that dynamical ejection of BN from
                   this triple system at its observed velocity leaves
                   behind a binary with total energy and eccentricity
                   matching those observed for theta1C. Five other
                   observed properties of theta1C are also consistent
                   with it having ejected BN and altogether we estimate
                   that there is only a <~ 10-5 probability that theta1C
                   has these properties by chance. We conclude that BN
                   was dynamically ejected from the theta1C system about
                   4500 years ago. BN then plowed through the KL massive
                   star-forming core within the last 1000 years causing

                   formation and gas expulsion. We draw our initial
                   conditions from observed properties of starless
                   clumps. We follow the early evolution of the clusters
                   up to 20 Myr, investigating the effects of different
                   star formation efficiencies, primordial binary
                   fractions and eccentricities, and primordial mass
                   segregation levels. We investigate clumps with
                   initial masses of {M}{cl}=3000 {M}&sun; embedded in
                   ambient cloud environments with mass surface
                   densities {{{Sigma }}}{cloud}=0.1 and 1 {{g}}
                   {{cm}}-2. We show that these models of fast star
                   cluster formation result, in the fiducial case, in
                   clusters that expand rapidly, even considering only
                   the bound members. Clusters formed from higher
                   {{{Sigma }}}{cloud} environments tend to expand more
                   quickly and thus are soon larger than clusters born
                   from lower {{{Sigma }}}{cloud} conditions. To form a
                   young cluster of a given age, stellar mass, and mass
                   surface density, these models need to assume a parent
                   molecular clump that is many times denser, which is
                   unrealistic compared to observed systems. We also
                   show that, in these models, the initial binary
                   properties are only slightly modified by
                   interactions, meaning that the binary properties,
                   e.g., at 20 Myr, are very similar to those at birth.
                   With this study, we set up the foundation for future
                   work, where we will investigate more realistic models
                   of star formation compared to this instantaneous,
                   baseline case.},

                   early B-type star and p+/e- bremsstrahlung can

                   theory concerns the transfer of angular momentum such
                   that mass can accrete onto a newly born young stellar
                   object (YSO). From a theoretical standpoint, outflows
                   and jets are predicted to play an essential role in
                   angular momentum transfer and their rotation motions
                   have been reported for both low- and high-mass YSOs.
                   However, little quantitative discussion on outflow
                   launching mechanisms have been presented for
                   high-mass YSOs due to a lack of observational data.
                   Here we present a clear signature of rotation in the
                   bipolar outflow driven by Orion Source I, a high-mass
                   YSO candidate, using the Atacama Large
                   Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). A rotational
                   transition of silicon monoxide (Si18O) reveals a
                   velocity gradient perpendicular to the outflow axis
                   which is consistent with that of the circumstellar
                   disk traced by a high-excitation water (H2O) line.
                   The launching radii and outward velocity of the
                   outflow are estimated to be >10 au and 10 km s-1,
                   respectively. These parameters rule out a possibility
                   that the observed outflow is produced by entrainment
                   of a high-velocity jet, and that contribution from
                   stellar-wind or X-wind which have smaller launching
                   radii are significant in the case of Source I. Thus,
                   present results provide a convincing evidence of a
                   rotating outflow directly driven by the
                   magneto-centrifugal disk wind launched by a high-mass
                   YSO candidate.},

                   protostellar discs in the Class 0 stage studying the
                   emission of molecular tracers like 13CO, C18O, HCO+,
                   H13CO+, N2H+, and H2CO. We model the emission of
                   discs around low- and intermediate-mass protostars.
                   We show that under optimal observing conditions ALMA
                   is able to detect the discs already in the earliest
                   stage of protostellar evolution, although the
                   emission is often concentrated to the innermost 50
                   au. Therefore, a resolution of a few 0.1 arcsec might
                   be too low to detect Keplerian discs around Class 0
                   objects. We also demonstrate that under optimal
                   conditions for edge-on discs Keplerian rotation
                   signatures are recognisable, from which protostellar
                   masses can be inferred. For this we here introduce a
                   new approach, which allows us to determine
                   protostellar masses with higher fidelity than before.
                   Furthermore, we show that it is possible to reveal
                   Keplerian rotation even for strongly inclined discs
                   and that ALMA should be able to detect possible signs
                   of fragmentation in face-on discs. In order to give
                   some guidance for future ALMA observations, we
                   investigate the influence of varying observing
                   conditions and source distances. We show that it is
                   possible to probe Keplerian rotation in inclined
                   discs with an observing time of 2 h and a resolution
                   of 0.1 arcsec, even in the case of moderate weather
                   conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that under
                   optimal conditions, Keplerian discs around
                   intermediate-mass protostars should be detectable up
                   to kpc distances.},

  abstract =      {Context. Source I in the Orion-KL nebula is believed
                   to be the nearest example of a massive star still in
                   the main accretion phase. It is thus one of the best
                   cases for studying the properties of massive
                   protostars to constrain high-mass star formation
                   theories. Near-infrared radiation from source I
                   escapes through the cavity opened by the OMC1 outflow
                   and is scattered by dust towards our line of sight.
                   Aims: The reflected spectrum offers a unique
                   possibility of observing the emission from the
                   innermost regions of the system and probing the
                   nature of source I and its immediate surroundings.
                   Methods: We obtained moderately high
                   spectral-resolution (lambda/Deltalambda 9000)
                   observations of the near infrared diffuse emission in
                   several locations around source I/Orion-KL. We
                   observed a widespread rich absorption line spectrum
                   that we compare with cool stellar photospheres and
                   protostellar accretion disk models. Results: The
                   spectrum is broadly similar to strongly veiled, cool,
                   low-gravity stellar photospheres in the range Teff
                   3500-4500 K, luminosity class I-III. An exact match
                   explaining all features has not been found, and a
                   plausible explanation is that a range of different
                   temperatures contribute to the observed absorption
                   spectrum. The 1D velocity dispersions implied by the
                   absorption spectra, sigma 30 km s-1, can be explained
                   by the emission from a disk around a massive, m_* 10
                   M_&sun;, protostar that is accreting at a high rate,
                   dot{m_*} 3 × 10-3 M_&sun; yr-1. Conclusions: Our
                   observations suggest that the near-infrared
                   reflection spectrum observed in the Orion-KL region
                   is produced close to source I and scattered to our
                   line of sight in the OMC1 outflow cavity. The
                   spectrum allows us to exclude source I being a very
                   large, massive protostar rotating at breakup speed.
                   We suggest that the absorption spectrum is produced
                   in a disk surrounding a 10 M_&sun; protostar,
                   accreting from its disk at a high rate of a few ×

  abstract =      {The Kleinmann--Low nebula in Orion, the closest
                   region of massive star formation, harbors Source I,
                   whose nature is under debate. Knowledge of this
                   source may have profound implications for our
                   understanding of the energetics of the hot core in
                   Orion KL since it might be the main heating source in
                   the region. The spectral energy distribution of this
                   source in the radio is characterized by a positive
                   spectral index close to 2, which is consistent with
                   (i) thermal bremsstrahlung emission of ionized
                   hydrogen gas produced by a central massive protostar,
                   or (ii) photospheric bremsstrahlung emission produced
                   by electrons when deflected by the interaction with
                   neutral and molecular hydrogen like Mira-like
                   variable stars. If ionized hydrogen gas were
                   responsible for the observed continuum emission, its
                   modeling would predict detectable emission from
                   hydrogen radio recombination lines (RRLs). However,
                   our SMA observations were obtained with a high enough
                   sensitivity to rule out that the radio continuum
                   emission arises from a dense hypercompact H II region
                   because the H26alpha line would have been detected,
                   in contrast with our observations. To explain the
                   observational constraints, we investigate further the
                   nature of the radio continuum emission from source I.
                   We have compared available radio continuum data with
                   the predictions from our upgraded non-LTE 3D
                   radiative transfer model, MOdel for REcombination
                   LInes, to show that radio continuum fluxes and sizes
                   can only be reproduced by assuming both dust and
                   bremsstrahlung emission from neutral gas. The dust
                   emission contribution is significant at nu >= 43 GHz.
                   In addition, our RRL peak intensity predictions for
                   the ionized metals case are consistent with the
                   nondetection of Na and K RRLs at millimeter and
                   submillimeter wavelengths.},

                   dusty disk with a radius of ˜60 au, deeply embedded
                   in an infalling-rotating flattened envelope. We have
                   spatially resolved this envelope-disk system with the
                   Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array at up to
                   ˜16 au (0."04) resolution. The envelope is detected
                   in HCO+ J = 4-3 down to the dusty disk. Complex
                   organic molecules (COMs) and doubly deuterated
                   formaldehyde (D2CO) are detected above and below the
                   dusty disk within ˜40 au of the central protostar.
                   The COMs are methanol (CH3OH), deuterated methanol
                   (CH2DOH), methyl mercaptan (CH3SH), and formamide
                   (NH2CHO, a prebiotic precursor). We have modeled the
                   gas kinematics in HCO+ and COMs and found a
                   centrifugal barrier (CB) at a radius of ˜44 au,
                   within which a Keplerian rotating disk is formed.
                   This indicates that HCO+ traces the
                   infalling-rotating envelope down to the CB and COMs
                   trace the atmosphere of a Keplerian rotating disk

                   the first time, both radially and vertically, in the
                   atmosphere of a disk in the earliest, Class 0 phase
                   of star formation. Our spatially resolved
                   observations of COMs favor their formation in the
                   disk rather than a rapidly infalling (warm) inner
                   envelope. The abundances and spatial distributions of
                   the COMs provide strong constraints on models of

                   gradient of the C18O emission along the elongation

                   reanalyzed, identifying Keplerian rotation
                   proportional to {{{r}}}-0.5 more clearly than the

                   estimated to be ˜74 au and ˜ 0.45 {M}&sun; ,
                   respectively. The continuum visibility is fitted by
                   models without any annulus averaging, revealing that
                   the disk is in hydrostatic equilibrium. The best-fit
                   model also suggests a density jump by a factor of ˜5
                   between the disk and the envelope, suggesting that
                   disks around protostars can be geometrically
                   distinguishable from the envelope from a viewpoint of
                   density contrast. Importantly, the disk radius
                   geometrically identified with the density jump is
                   consistent with the kinematically estimated radius.
                   Possible origin of the density jump due to the mass
                   accretion from the envelope to the disk is discussed.
                   C18O observations can be reproduced by the same
                   geometrical structures derived from the dust

                   surrounded by an infalling and rotating envelope.
                   C18O emission shows strong redshifted absorption
                   against the bright continuum emission associated with
                   L1527 IRS, strongly suggesting infall motions in the
                   C18O envelope. The C18O envelope also rotates with a
                   velocity mostly proportional to r -1, where r is the
                   radius, whereas the rotation profile at the innermost
                   radius (~54 AU) may be shallower than r -1,
                   suggestive of formation of a Keplerian disk around
                   the central protostar of ~0.3 M &sun; in dynamical
                   mass. SO emission arising from the inner part of the
                   C18O envelope also shows rotation in the same
                   direction as the C18O envelope. The rotation is,
                   however, rigid-body-like, which is very different
                   from the differential rotation shown by C18O. In
                   order to explain the line profiles and the
                   position-velocity (PV) diagrams of C18O and SO
                   observed, simple models composed of an infalling
                   envelope surrounding a Keplerian disk of 54 AU in
                   radius orbiting a star of 0.3 M &sun; are examined.
                   It is found that in order to reproduce characteristic
                   features of the observed line profiles and PV
                   diagrams, the infall velocity in the model has to be
                   smaller than the free-fall velocity yielded by a star
                   of 0.3 M &sun;. Possible reasons for the reduced
                   infall velocities are discussed.},

  abstract =      {Context. The R CrA cloud hosts a handful of Class 0/I
                   low-mass young stellar objects. The chemistry and
                   physics at scales >500 AU in this cloud are dominated
                   by the irradiation from the nearby Herbig Be star R
                   CrA. The luminous large-scale emission makes it
                   necessary to use high-resolution spectral imaging to
                   study the chemistry and dynamics of the inner
                   envelopes and discs of the protostars. Aims: We aim
                   to better understand the structure of the inner
                   regions of these protostars and, in particular, the
                   interplay between the chemistry and the presence of
                   discs. Methods: Using Atacama Large
                   Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) high-resolution
                   spectral imaging interferometry observations, we
                   study the molecular line and dust continuum emission
                   at submillimetre wavelengths. Results: We detect dust
                   continuum emission from four circumstellar discs
                   around Class 0/I objects within the R CrA cloud.
                   Towards IRS7B we detect C17O emission showing a
                   rotation curve consistent with a Keplerian disc with
                   a well-defined edge that gives a good estimate for
                   the disc radius at 50 AU. We derive the central
                   object mass to 2.3 M&sun; and the disc mass to 0.024
                   M&sun;. The observations are also consistent with a
                   model of material infalling under conservation of
                   angular momentum; however, this model provides a
                   worse fit to the data. We also report a likely
                   detection of faint CH3OH emission towards this point
                   source, as well as more luminous CH3OH emission in an
                   outflow orthogonal to the major axis of the C17O
                   emission. Conclusions: The faint CH3OH emission seen
                   towards IRS7B can be explained by a flat density
                   profile of the inner envelope caused by the disc with
                   a radius ≲50 AU. We propose that the regions of the
                   envelopes where complex organic molecules are present
                   in Class 0/I young stellar objects can become
                   quenched as the disc grows.},

  abstract =      {Context. Rotationally supported disks are critical in
                   the star formation process. The questions of when
                   they form and what factors influence or hinder their
                   formation have been studied but are largely
                   unanswered. Observations of early-stage YSOs are
                   needed to probe disk formation. Aims: VLA1623 is a
                   triple non-coeval protostellar system, with a weak
                   magnetic field perpendicular to the outflow, whose
                   Class 0 component, VLA1623A, shows a disk-like
                   structure in continuum with signatures of rotation in
                   line emission. We aim to determine whether this
                   structure is in part or in whole a rotationally
                   supported disk, i.e. a Keplerian disk, and what its
                   characteristics are. Methods: ALMA Cycle 0 Early
                   Science 1.3 mm continuum and C18O (2-1) observations
                   in the extended configuration are presented here and
                   used to perform an analysis of the disk-like
                   structure using position-velocity (PV) diagrams and
                   thin disk modeling with the addition of foreground
                   absorption. Results: The PV diagrams of the C18O line
                   emission suggest the presence of a rotationally
                   supported component with a radius of at least 50 AU.
                   Kinematical modeling of the line emission shows that
                   the disk out to 180 AU is actually rotationally
                   supported, with the rotation described well by
                   Keplerian rotation out to at least 150 AU, and the
                   central source mass is ~0.2 M&sun; for an inclination
                   of 55$\,^{\circ}$. Pure infall and conserved angular
                   momentum rotation models are excluded. Conclusions:
                   VLA1623A, a very young Class 0 source, presents a
                   disk with an outer radius Rout = 180 AU with a
                   Keplerian velocity structure out to at least 150 AU.
                   The weak magnetic fields and recent fragmentation in
                   this region of rho Ophiuchus may have played a
                   leading role in the formation of the disk. Appendices
