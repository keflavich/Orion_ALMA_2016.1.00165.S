                   GHz}},
  year =          {2016},
  abstract =      {Orion Source I ('SrcI') is the protostar at the
                   center of the Kleinmann-Low Nebula. ALMA observations
                   of SrcI at 350 and 660 GHz failed to detect the
                   H26$\alpha$ and H21$\alpha$ recombination lines,
                   ruling out the possibility that SrcI is a
                   hypercompact HII region. The deconvolved size of the
                   continuum source is approximately 0.23 x 0.05" (100 x
                   20 AU); it is interpreted as a disk viewed almost
                   edge-on. The continuum flux density is proportional
                   to $\nu^2$ from 43 GHz to 350 GHz, then increases
                   slightly faster than $\nu^2$ from 350 GHz to 660 GHz.
                   Optically thick thermal emission from ~500 K dust is
                   the most plausible source of the continuum, even at
                   frequencies as low as 43 GHz; the disk mass is most
                   likely in the range 0.02-0.2 Mo. A rich spectrum of
                   molecular lines is detected, mostly from sulfur- and
                   silicon-rich molecules like SO, SO$_2$, and SiS, but
                   also including vibrationally excited CO and several
                   unidentified transitions. Lines with upper energy
                   levels E$_U$ > 500 K appear in emission and are
                   symmetric about the source's LSR velocity of 5
                   km/sec, while lines with E$_U$ < 500 K appear as
                   blueshifted absorption features against the
                   continuum, indicating that they originate in
                   outflowing gas. The emission lines exhibit a velocity
                   gradient along the major axis of the disk that is
                   consistent with rotation around a 5-7 Mo central
                   object. The relatively low mass of SrcI and the
                   existence of a 100 AU disk around it are incompatible
                   with the model in which SrcI and the nearby
                   Becklin-Neugebauer Object were ejected from a
                   multiple system 500 years ago.},

                   Array (ALMA) observations of a circumstellar disk
                   around Source I in Orion KL, an archetype of massive
                   protostar candidates. We detected two ortho-H2O lines
                   at 321 GHz (102, 9-93, 6) and 336 GHz (nu2 = 1, 52,
                   3-61, 6) for the first time in Source I. The latter
                   one is in a vibrationally excited state at the lower
                   state energy of 2939 K, suggesting evidence of hot
                   molecular gas close to Source I. The integrated
                   intensity map of the 321 GHz line is elongated along
                   the bipolar outflow while the 336 GHz line map is
                   unresolved with a beam size of 0.''4. Both of these
                   maps show velocity gradients perpendicular to the
                   bipolar outflow. The velocity centroid map of the 321
                   GHz line implies a spatial and velocity structure
                   similar to that of vibrationally excited SiO masers
                   tracing the root of the outflow emanating from the
                   disk surface. In contrast, the 336 GHz line is most
                   likely emitting from the disk midplane with a
                   diameter of 0.''2 (84 AU) as traced by radio
                   continuum emission and a dark lane devoid of the
                   vibrationally excited SiO maser emission. The
                   observed velocity gradient and the spectral profile
                   of the 336 GHz H2O line can be reconciled with a
                   model of an edge-on ring-like structure with an
                   enclosed mass of >7 M &sun; and an excitation
                   temperature of >3000 K. The present results provide
                   further evidence of a hot and neutral circumstellar
                   disk rotating around Source I with a diameter of ~100

                   emission toward the massive young stellar object
                   (YSO) Orion Source I. Both SiO transitions were
                   observed simultaneously with an angular resolution of
                   ~0.5 mas (~0.2 AU for d = 414 pc) and a spectral
                   resolution of ~0.2 km s-1. Here we explore the global
                   properties and kinematics of the emission through two
                   19-epoch animated movies spanning 21 months (from
                   2001 March 19 to 2002 December 10). These movies
                   provide the most detailed view to date of the
                   dynamics and temporal evolution of molecular material
                   within ~20-100 AU of a massive (gsim8 M sun) YSO. As
                   in previous studies, we find that the bulk of the SiO
                   masers surrounding Source I lie in an X-shaped locus;
                   the emission in the south and east arms is
                   predominantly blueshifted, and emission in the north
                   and west is predominantly redshifted. In addition,
                   bridges of intermediate-velocity emission are
                   observed connecting the red and blue sides of the
                   emission distribution. We have measured proper
                   motions of over 1000 individual maser features and
                   found that these motions are characterized by a
                   combination of radially outward migrations along the
                   four main maser-emitting arms and motions tangent to
                   the intermediate-velocity bridges. We interpret the
                   SiO masers as arising from a wide-angle bipolar wind
                   emanating from a rotating, edge-on disk. The
                   detection of maser features along extended, curved
                   filaments suggests that magnetic fields may play a
                   role in launching and/or shaping the wind. Our
                   observations appear to support a picture in which
                   stars with masses as high as at least 8 M sun form
                   via disk-mediated accretion. However, we cannot yet
                   rule out that the Source I disk may have been formed
                   or altered following a recent close encounter.},

  abstract =      {We have measured astrometry for members of the Orion
                   Nebula Cluster with images obtained in 2015 with the
                   Wide Field Camera 3 on board the Hubble Space
                   Telescope. By comparing those data to previous
                   measurements with NICMOS on Hubble in 1998, we have
                   discovered that a star in the Kleinmann-Low Nebula,
                   source x from Lonsdale et al. (1982), is moving with
                   an unusually high proper motion of 29 mas/yr, which
                   corresponds to 55 km/s at the distance of Orion.
                   Previous radio observations have found that three
                   other stars in the Kleinmann-Low Nebula (BN and
                   sources I and n) have high proper motions (5-14
                   mas/yr) and were near a single location ~540 years
                   ago, and thus may have been members of a multiple
                   system that dynamically decayed. The proper motion of
                   source x is consistent with ejection from that same
                   location 540 years ago, which provides strong
                   evidence that the dynamical decay did occur and that
                   the runaway star BN originated in the Kleinmann-Low
                   Nebula rather than the nearby Trapezium cluster.
                   However, our constraint on the motion of source n is
                   significantly smaller than the most recent radio
                   measurement, which indicates that it did not
                   participate in the event that ejected the other three
                   stars.},

                   contrasted with the gradual accumulation of mass by
                   accretion. In high-density protostar clusters,
                   envelopes and disks provide a viscous medium that can
                   dissipate the kinetic energy of passing stars,
                   greatly enhancing the probability of capture.
                   Protostellar mergers may produce high-luminosity
                   infrared flares lasting years to centuries followed
                   by a luminosity decline on the Kelvin-Helmholtz
                   timescale of the merger product. Mergers may be
                   surrounded by thick tori of expanding debris,
                   impulsive wide-angle outflows, and shock-induced
                   maser and radio continuum emission. Collision
                   products are expected to have fast stellar rotation
                   and a large multiplicity fraction. Close encounters
                   or mergers will produce circumstellar debris disks
                   with an orientation that differs from that of a
                   preexisting disk. Thus, massive stars growing by a
                   series of mergers may produce eruptive outflows with
                   random orientations; the walls of the resulting
                   outflow cavities may be observable as filaments of
                   dense gas and dust pointing away from the massive
                   star. The extremely rare merger of two stars close to
                   the upper-mass end of the initial mass function may
                   be a possible pathway to hypernova-generated
                   gamma-ray bursts. In contrast with the violence of
                   merging, the gradual growth of massive stars by
                   accretion is likely to produce less infrared
                   variability, relatively thin circumstellar accretion
                   disks that maintain their orientation, and collimated
                   bipolar outflows that are scaled-up versions of those
                   produced by low-mass young stellar objects. While
                   such accretional growth can lead to the formation of
                   massive stars in isolation or in loose clusters,
                   mergers can only occur in high-density cluster
                   environments. It is proposed that the outflow
                   emerging from the OMC-1 core in the Orion molecular
                   cloud was produced by a protostellar merger that
                   released between 1048 and 1049 ergs less than a
                   thousand years ago.},

                   in this context have been scarce, largely owing to
                   difficulties in probing the circumstellar gas at
                   scales 10-100 AU around high-mass YSOs, which are on
                   average distant (>1 Kpc), form in clusters, and
                   ignite quickly whilst still enshrouded in dusty
                   envelopes. Radio Source I in Orion BN/KL is the
                   nearest example of a high-mass YSO, and only one of
                   three YSOs known to power SiO masers. Using VLA and
                   VLBA observations of different SiO maser transitions,
                   the KaLYPSO project
                   (http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/kalypso/) aims to
                   overcome past observational limitations by mapping
                   the structure, 3-D velocity field, and dynamical
                   evolution of the circumstellar gas within 1000 AU
                   from Source I. Based on 19 epochs of VLBA
                   observations of v=1,2 SiO masers over ~2 years, we
                   produced a movie of bulk gas flow tracing the compact
                   disk and the base of the protostellar wind at radii <
                   100 AU from Source I. In addition, we have used the
                   VLA to map 7mm SiO v=0 emission and track proper
                   motions over 10 years. We identify a narrowly
                   collimated outflow with a mean motion of 18 km/s at
                   radii 100-1000 AU, along a NE-SW axis perpendicular
                   to that of the disk traced by the v=1,2 masers. The
                   VLBA and VLA data exclude alternate models that place
                   outflow from Source I along a NW-SE axis. The
                   analysis of the complete (VLBA and VLA) dataset
                   provides the most detailed evidence to date that
                   high-mass star formation occurs via disk-mediated
                   accretion.},

                   (KL) outflow emerging from OMC1 behind the Orion
                   Nebula may have been powered by the dynamical decay
                   of a non-hierarchical multiple system ~500 years ago
                   that ejected the massive stars I, BN, and source n,
                   with velocities of about 10-30 km s-1. New
                   proper-motion measurements of H2 features show that
                   within the errors of measurement, the outflow
                   originated from the site of stellar ejection.
                   Combined with published data, these measurements
                   indicate an outflow age of ~500 years, similar to the
                   time since stellar ejection. The total kinetic energy
                   of the ejected stars and the outflow is about 2 to 6
                   {\~A}--- 1047 erg. It is proposed that the
                   gravitational potential energy released by the
                   formation of a short-period binary, most likely
                   source I, resulted in stellar ejection and powered
                   the outflow. A scenario is presented for the
                   formation of a compact, non-hierarchical multiple
                   star system, its decay into an ejected binary and two
                   high-velocity stars, and launch of the outflow. Three
                   mechanisms may have contributed to the explosion in
                   the gas: (1) unbinding of the circumcluster envelope
                   following stellar ejection, (2) disruption of
                   circumstellar disks and high-speed expulsion of the
                   resulting debris during the final stellar encounter,
                   and (3) the release of stored magnetic energy.
                   Plausible protostellar disk end envelope properties
                   can produce the observed outflow mass, velocity, and
                   kinetic energy distributions. The ejected stars may
                   have acquired new disks by fall-back or Bondi-Hoyle
                   accretion with axes roughly orthogonal to their
                   velocities. The expulsion of gas and stars from OMC1
                   may have been driven by stellar interactions.},

                   the hypothesis that the explosive BN/KL outflow from

                   dynamical decay of a non-hierarchical system of
                   massive stars. Methods: Narrow-band H2, [Fe ii], and
                   broad-band Ks obtained with the Gemini South
                   multi-conjugate AO system GeMS and near-IR imager

                   of the 8-m telescope at 2.12 mum. Comparison with
                   previous AO-assisted observations of sub-fields and
                   other ground-based observations enable measurements
                   of proper motions and the investigation of
                   morphological changes in H2 and [Fe ii] features with
                   unprecedented precision. The images are compared with
                   numerical simulations of compact, high-density clumps
                   moving ~103 times their own diameter through a lower
                   density medium at Mach 103. Results: Several
                   sub-arcsecond H2 features and many [Fe ii]
                   "fingertips" on the projected outskirts of the flow
                   show proper motions of ~300 km s-1. High-velocity,
                   sub-arcsecond H2 knots ("bullets") are seen as far as
                   140'' from their suspected ejection site. If these
                   knots propagated through the dense Orion A cloud,
                   their survival sets a lower bound on their densities
                   of order 107 cm-3, consistent with an origin within a
                   few au of a massive star and accelerated by a final
                   multi-body dynamic encounter that ejected the BN
                   object and radio source I from OMC1 about 500 yr ago.
                   Conclusions: Over 120 high-velocity bow-shocks
                   propagating in nearly all directions from the OMC1
                   cloud core provide evidence for an explosive origin
                   for the BN/KL outflow triggered by the dynamic decay
                   of a non-hierarchical system of massive stars. Such
                   events may be linked to the origin of runaway,

                   gravitational interactions with other stars may be
                   common. The two nearest forming massive stars, the BN
                   object and Source I, located behind the Orion Nebula,
                   were ejected with velocities of ˜29 and ˜13 km s-1
                   about 500 years ago by such interactions. This event
                   generated an explosion in the gas. New ALMA
                   observations show in unprecedented detail, a roughly
                   spherically symmetric distribution of over a hundred
                   12CO J = 2-1 streamers with velocities extending from
                   V LSR = -150 to +145 km s-1. The streamer radial
                   velocities increase (or decrease) linearly with
                   projected distance from the explosion center, forming
                   a ``Hubble Flow'' confined to within 50" of the
                   explosion center. They point toward the high
                   proper-motion, shock-excited H2 and [Fe ii]
                   ``fingertips'' and lower-velocity CO in the H2 wakes
                   comprising Orion's ``fingers.'' In some directions,
                   the H2 ``fingers'' extend more than a factor of two
                   farther from the ejection center than the CO
                   streamers. Such deviations from spherical symmetry
                   may be caused by ejecta running into dense gas or the
                   dynamics of the N-body interaction that ejected the
                   stars and produced the explosion. This ˜1048 erg
                   event may have been powered by the release of
                   gravitational potential energy associated with the
                   formation of a compact binary or a protostellar
                   merger. Orion may be the prototype for a new class of
                   stellar explosiozn responsible for luminous infrared

                   ground for theoretical models. Of particular interest
                   among the ONC's ~1000 members are: theta1 Ori C, the
                   most massive binary in the cluster with stars of
                   masses 38 and 9 M &sun; the Becklin-Neugebauer (BN)
                   object, a 30 km s-1 runaway star of ~8 M &sun; and
                   the Kleinmann-Low (KL) nebula protostar, a highly
                   obscured, ~15 M &sun; object still accreting gas
                   while also driving a powerful, apparently "explosive"
                   outflow. The unusual behavior of BN and KL is much
                   debated: How did BN acquire its high velocity? How is
                   this related to massive star formation in the KL
                   nebula? Here, we report the results of a systematic
                   survey using ~107 numerical experiments of
                   gravitational interactions of the theta1C and BN
                   stars. We show that dynamical ejection of BN from
                   this triple system at its observed velocity leaves
                   behind a binary with total energy and eccentricity
                   matching those observed for theta1C. Five other
                   observed properties of theta1C are also consistent
                   with it having ejected BN and altogether we estimate
                   that there is only a <~ 10-5 probability that theta1C
                   has these properties by chance. We conclude that BN
                   was dynamically ejected from the theta1C system about
                   4500 years ago. BN then plowed through the KL massive
                   star-forming core within the last 1000 years causing
                   its recently enhanced accretion and outflow

                   star clusters, assuming that they form from a
                   turbulent starless clump of a given mass bounded
                   inside a parent self-gravitating molecular cloud
                   characterized by a particular mass surface density.
                   As a first step, we assume instantaneous star cluster
                   formation and gas expulsion. We draw our initial
                   conditions from observed properties of starless
                   clumps. We follow the early evolution of the clusters
                   up to 20 Myr, investigating the effects of different
                   star formation efficiencies, primordial binary
                   fractions and eccentricities, and primordial mass
                   segregation levels. We investigate clumps with
                   initial masses of {M}{cl}=3000 {M}&sun; embedded in
                   ambient cloud environments with mass surface
                   densities {{{Sigma }}}{cloud}=0.1 and 1 {{g}}
                   {{cm}}-2. We show that these models of fast star
                   cluster formation result, in the fiducial case, in
                   clusters that expand rapidly, even considering only
                   the bound members. Clusters formed from higher
                   {{{Sigma }}}{cloud} environments tend to expand more
                   quickly and thus are soon larger than clusters born
                   from lower {{{Sigma }}}{cloud} conditions. To form a
                   young cluster of a given age, stellar mass, and mass
                   surface density, these models need to assume a parent
                   molecular clump that is many times denser, which is
                   unrealistic compared to observed systems. We also
                   show that, in these models, the initial binary
                   properties are only slightly modified by
                   interactions, meaning that the binary properties,
                   e.g., at 20 Myr, are very similar to those at birth.
                   With this study, we set up the foundation for future
                   work, where we will investigate more realistic models
                   of star formation compared to this instantaneous,

                   (nu2 = 1, 55, 0-64, 3). This line has been detected
                   previously in circumstellar envelopes of late-type
                   stars but not in young stellar objects such as Orion
                   KL. Thus, this is the first detection of the 232 GHz
                   vibrationally excited H2O maser in star-forming
                   regions. The distribution of the 232 GHz maser is
                   concentrated at the position of the radio Source I,
                   which is remarkably different from other molecular
                   lines. The spectrum shows a double-peak structure at
                   the peak velocities of -2.1 and 13.3 km s-1. It
                   appears to be consistent with the 22 GHz H2O masers
                   and 43 GHz SiO masers observed around Source I. Thus,
                   the 232 GHz H2O maser around Source I would be
                   excited by the internal heating by an embedded
                   protostar, being associated with either the root of
                   the outflows/jets or the circumstellar disk around
                   Source I, as traced by the 22 GHz H2O masers or 43
                   GHz SiO masers, respectively.},

                   protostellar discs in the Class 0 stage studying the
                   emission of molecular tracers like 13CO, C18O, HCO+,
                   H13CO+, N2H+, and H2CO. We model the emission of
                   discs around low- and intermediate-mass protostars.
                   We show that under optimal observing conditions ALMA
                   is able to detect the discs already in the earliest
                   stage of protostellar evolution, although the
                   emission is often concentrated to the innermost 50
                   au. Therefore, a resolution of a few 0.1 arcsec might
                   be too low to detect Keplerian discs around Class 0
                   objects. We also demonstrate that under optimal
                   conditions for edge-on discs Keplerian rotation
                   signatures are recognisable, from which protostellar
                   masses can be inferred. For this we here introduce a
                   new approach, which allows us to determine
                   protostellar masses with higher fidelity than before.
                   Furthermore, we show that it is possible to reveal
                   Keplerian rotation even for strongly inclined discs
                   and that ALMA should be able to detect possible signs
                   of fragmentation in face-on discs. In order to give
                   some guidance for future ALMA observations, we
                   investigate the influence of varying observing
                   conditions and source distances. We show that it is
                   possible to probe Keplerian rotation in inclined
                   discs with an observing time of 2 h and a resolution
                   of 0.1 arcsec, even in the case of moderate weather
                   conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that under
                   optimal conditions, Keplerian discs around
                   intermediate-mass protostars should be detectable up
                   to kpc distances.},

                   in the Orion KL nebula with the VLA at 43 GHz with 34
                   mas angular resolution. The continuum emission is
                   highly elongated and is consistent with that expected
                   from a nearly edge-on disk. The high brightness and
                   lack of strong molecular lines from Orion I can be
                   used to argue against emission from dust. Collisional
                   ionization and H- free-free opacity, as in Mira
                   variables, require a central star with >~105 Lsolar,
                   which is greater than infrared observations allow.
                   However, if significant local heating associated with
                   accretion occurs, lower total luminosities are
                   possible. Alternatively, photoionization from an
                   early B-type star and p+/e- bremsstrahlung can
                   explain our observations, and Orion I may be an
                   example of ionized accretion disk surrounding a
                   forming massive star. Such accretion disks may not be
                   able to form planets efficiently.},

  abstract =      {Context. Source I in the Orion-KL nebula is believed
                   to be the nearest example of a massive star still in
                   the main accretion phase. It is thus one of the best
                   cases for studying the properties of massive
                   protostars to constrain high-mass star formation
                   theories. Near-infrared radiation from source I
                   escapes through the cavity opened by the OMC1 outflow
                   and is scattered by dust towards our line of sight.
                   Aims: The reflected spectrum offers a unique
                   possibility of observing the emission from the
                   innermost regions of the system and probing the
                   nature of source I and its immediate surroundings.
                   Methods: We obtained moderately high
                   spectral-resolution (lambda/Deltalambda 9000)
                   observations of the near infrared diffuse emission in
                   several locations around source I/Orion-KL. We
                   observed a widespread rich absorption line spectrum
                   that we compare with cool stellar photospheres and
                   protostellar accretion disk models. Results: The
                   spectrum is broadly similar to strongly veiled, cool,
                   low-gravity stellar photospheres in the range Teff
                   3500-4500 K, luminosity class I-III. An exact match
                   explaining all features has not been found, and a
                   plausible explanation is that a range of different
                   temperatures contribute to the observed absorption
                   spectrum. The 1D velocity dispersions implied by the
                   absorption spectra, sigma 30 km s-1, can be explained
                   by the emission from a disk around a massive, m_* 10
                   M_&sun;, protostar that is accreting at a high rate,
                   dot{m_*} 3 × 10-3 M_&sun; yr-1. Conclusions: Our
                   observations suggest that the near-infrared
                   reflection spectrum observed in the Orion-KL region
                   is produced close to source I and scattered to our
                   line of sight in the OMC1 outflow cavity. The
                   spectrum allows us to exclude source I being a very
                   large, massive protostar rotating at breakup speed.
                   We suggest that the absorption spectrum is produced
                   in a disk surrounding a 10 M_&sun; protostar,
                   accreting from its disk at a high rate of a few ×
