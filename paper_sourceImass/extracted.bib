  abstract =      {We report new Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter
                   Array (ALMA) observations of a circumstellar disk
                   around Source I in Orion KL, an archetype of massive
                   protostar candidates. We detected two ortho-H2O lines
                   at 321 GHz (102, 9-93, 6) and 336 GHz (nu2 = 1, 52,
                   3-61, 6) for the first time in Source I. The latter
                   one is in a vibrationally excited state at the lower
                   state energy of 2939 K, suggesting evidence of hot
                   molecular gas close to Source I. The integrated
                   intensity map of the 321 GHz line is elongated along
                   the bipolar outflow while the 336 GHz line map is
                   unresolved with a beam size of 0.''4. Both of these
                   maps show velocity gradients perpendicular to the
                   bipolar outflow. The velocity centroid map of the 321
                   GHz line implies a spatial and velocity structure
                   similar to that of vibrationally excited SiO masers
                   tracing the root of the outflow emanating from the
                   disk surface. In contrast, the 336 GHz line is most
                   likely emitting from the disk midplane with a
                   diameter of 0.''2 (84 AU) as traced by radio
                   continuum emission and a dark lane devoid of the
                   vibrationally excited SiO maser emission. The
                   observed velocity gradient and the spectral profile
                   of the 336 GHz H2O line can be reconciled with a
                   model of an edge-on ring-like structure with an
                   enclosed mass of >7 M &sun; and an excitation
                   temperature of >3000 K. The present results provide
                   further evidence of a hot and neutral circumstellar
                   disk rotating around Source I with a diameter of ~100
                   AU scale.},

                   GHz}},
  year =          {2016},
  abstract =      {Orion Source I ('SrcI') is the protostar at the
                   center of the Kleinmann-Low Nebula. ALMA observations
                   of SrcI at 350 and 660 GHz failed to detect the
                   H26$\alpha$ and H21$\alpha$ recombination lines,
                   ruling out the possibility that SrcI is a
                   hypercompact HII region. The deconvolved size of the
                   continuum source is approximately 0.23 x 0.05" (100 x
                   20 AU); it is interpreted as a disk viewed almost
                   edge-on. The continuum flux density is proportional
                   to $\nu^2$ from 43 GHz to 350 GHz, then increases
                   slightly faster than $\nu^2$ from 350 GHz to 660 GHz.
                   Optically thick thermal emission from ~500 K dust is
                   the most plausible source of the continuum, even at
                   frequencies as low as 43 GHz; the disk mass is most
                   likely in the range 0.02-0.2 Mo. A rich spectrum of
                   molecular lines is detected, mostly from sulfur- and
                   silicon-rich molecules like SO, SO$_2$, and SiS, but
                   also including vibrationally excited CO and several
                   unidentified transitions. Lines with upper energy
                   levels E$_U$ > 500 K appear in emission and are
                   symmetric about the source's LSR velocity of 5
                   km/sec, while lines with E$_U$ < 500 K appear as
                   blueshifted absorption features against the
                   continuum, indicating that they originate in
                   outflowing gas. The emission lines exhibit a velocity
                   gradient along the major axis of the disk that is
                   consistent with rotation around a 5-7 Mo central
                   object. The relatively low mass of SrcI and the
                   existence of a 100 AU disk around it are incompatible
                   with the model in which SrcI and the nearby
                   Becklin-Neugebauer Object were ejected from a
                   multiple system 500 years ago.},

                   emission toward the massive young stellar object
                   (YSO) Orion Source I. Both SiO transitions were
                   observed simultaneously with an angular resolution of
                   ~0.5 mas (~0.2 AU for d = 414 pc) and a spectral
                   resolution of ~0.2 km s-1. Here we explore the global
                   properties and kinematics of the emission through two
                   19-epoch animated movies spanning 21 months (from
                   2001 March 19 to 2002 December 10). These movies
                   provide the most detailed view to date of the
                   dynamics and temporal evolution of molecular material
                   within ~20-100 AU of a massive (gsim8 M sun) YSO. As
                   in previous studies, we find that the bulk of the SiO
                   masers surrounding Source I lie in an X-shaped locus;
                   the emission in the south and east arms is
                   predominantly blueshifted, and emission in the north
                   and west is predominantly redshifted. In addition,
                   bridges of intermediate-velocity emission are
                   observed connecting the red and blue sides of the
                   emission distribution. We have measured proper
                   motions of over 1000 individual maser features and
                   found that these motions are characterized by a
                   combination of radially outward migrations along the
                   four main maser-emitting arms and motions tangent to
                   the intermediate-velocity bridges. We interpret the
                   SiO masers as arising from a wide-angle bipolar wind
                   emanating from a rotating, edge-on disk. The
                   detection of maser features along extended, curved
                   filaments suggests that magnetic fields may play a
                   role in launching and/or shaping the wind. Our
                   observations appear to support a picture in which
                   stars with masses as high as at least 8 M sun form
                   via disk-mediated accretion. However, we cannot yet
                   rule out that the Source I disk may have been formed
                   or altered following a recent close encounter.},

                   (nu2 = 1, 55, 0-64, 3). This line has been detected
                   previously in circumstellar envelopes of late-type
                   stars but not in young stellar objects such as Orion
                   KL. Thus, this is the first detection of the 232 GHz
                   vibrationally excited H2O maser in star-forming
                   regions. The distribution of the 232 GHz maser is
                   concentrated at the position of the radio Source I,
                   which is remarkably different from other molecular
                   lines. The spectrum shows a double-peak structure at

                   appears to be consistent with the 22 GHz H2O masers

                   the 232 GHz H2O maser around Source I would be
                   excited by the internal heating by an embedded
                   protostar, being associated with either the root of
                   the outflows/jets or the circumstellar disk around
                   Source I, as traced by the 22 GHz H2O masers or 43

                   protostellar discs in the Class 0 stage studying the
                   emission of molecular tracers like 13CO, C18O, HCO+,
                   H13CO+, N2H+, and H2CO. We model the emission of
                   discs around low- and intermediate-mass protostars.
                   We show that under optimal observing conditions ALMA
                   is able to detect the discs already in the earliest
                   stage of protostellar evolution, although the
                   emission is often concentrated to the innermost 50
                   au. Therefore, a resolution of a few 0.1 arcsec might
                   be too low to detect Keplerian discs around Class 0
                   objects. We also demonstrate that under optimal
                   conditions for edge-on discs Keplerian rotation
                   signatures are recognisable, from which protostellar
                   masses can be inferred. For this we here introduce a
                   new approach, which allows us to determine
                   protostellar masses with higher fidelity than before.
                   Furthermore, we show that it is possible to reveal
                   Keplerian rotation even for strongly inclined discs
                   and that ALMA should be able to detect possible signs
                   of fragmentation in face-on discs. In order to give
                   some guidance for future ALMA observations, we
                   investigate the influence of varying observing
                   conditions and source distances. We show that it is
                   possible to probe Keplerian rotation in inclined
                   discs with an observing time of 2 h and a resolution
                   of 0.1 arcsec, even in the case of moderate weather
                   conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that under
                   optimal conditions, Keplerian discs around
                   intermediate-mass protostars should be detectable up
                   to kpc distances.},

                   (KL) outflow emerging from OMC1 behind the Orion
                   Nebula may have been powered by the dynamical decay
                   of a non-hierarchical multiple system ~500 years ago
                   that ejected the massive stars I, BN, and source n,
                   with velocities of about 10-30 km s-1. New
                   proper-motion measurements of H2 features show that
                   within the errors of measurement, the outflow
                   originated from the site of stellar ejection.
                   Combined with published data, these measurements
                   indicate an outflow age of ~500 years, similar to the
                   time since stellar ejection. The total kinetic energy
                   of the ejected stars and the outflow is about 2 to 6
                   {\~A}--- 1047 erg. It is proposed that the
                   gravitational potential energy released by the
                   formation of a short-period binary, most likely
                   source I, resulted in stellar ejection and powered
                   the outflow. A scenario is presented for the
                   formation of a compact, non-hierarchical multiple
                   star system, its decay into an ejected binary and two
                   high-velocity stars, and launch of the outflow. Three
                   mechanisms may have contributed to the explosion in
                   the gas: (1) unbinding of the circumcluster envelope
                   following stellar ejection, (2) disruption of
                   circumstellar disks and high-speed expulsion of the
                   resulting debris during the final stellar encounter,
                   and (3) the release of stored magnetic energy.
                   Plausible protostellar disk end envelope properties
                   can produce the observed outflow mass, velocity, and
                   kinetic energy distributions. The ejected stars may
                   have acquired new disks by fall-back or Bondi-Hoyle
                   accretion with axes roughly orthogonal to their
                   velocities. The expulsion of gas and stars from OMC1
                   may have been driven by stellar interactions.},
