\title{The Mass of Orion's Source I}
\begin{abstract}
   We resolve the disk around source I and measure the rotation curve.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

Several attempts have been made to measure the mass of Orion Source I using the
rotation curve of various molecular lines:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \citet{Hirota2014a} observed vibrationally excited \water emission
        from the $v_2=0, 10_{2,9}-9_{3,6}$ and  $v_2=1, 5_{2,3}-6_{1,6}$ lines
        with $E_L=1846$ and 2939 K, respectively.  They imaged these lines
        with $0.40\arcsec\times0.34\arcsec$ resolution and made
        \textit{velocity centroid maps} of the position of peak intensity
        as a function of velocity to measure the rotationally supported
        mass in Source I.  They obtained a mass estimate of $5-7\msun$.
    \item \citet{Plambeck2016a} measured both the continuum SED and the rotation
        curve of gas around Source I.  They used a centroiding approach
        similar to \citet{Hirota2014a} to measure the rotation curve of
        SO, SiS, SiO, and CO and infer the source mass $M\sim5-7$ \msun.
    \item \citet{Matthews2010a} used 3D measurements of SiO maser velocities
        at 0.5 mas (0.2 AU) resolution along a `bridge' hovering just above and
        below the disk and an assumed radius $r\sim35$ AU  to infer a mass
        $M\approx8-10$ \msun.
\end{itemize}

\section{Observations}

At 1.3 mm in our Robust 0.5 image, the beam is $0.052\times0.030$ \arcsec at
PA$=-77.7\degrees$ ($21.8\times12.7$ AU), resulting in a 
conversion factor of 15000 K Jy$^{-1}$.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Continuum}
We detect the disk in the continuum at 3mm, 1mm, and 0.8mm, but we detect
spectral lines only from the surfaces above and below the continuum disk at 1
mm (Figure \ref{fig:contdata} shows the 1 mm continuum).  The nondetection of
lines in the disk midplane is a strong indication that the continuum is
optically thick, as has previously been noted
\citep[e.g.][]{Plambeck2016a}.

We fit the 1.3 mm continuum image with a simple model to determine the basic
observational structure.  We used a linear model (i.e., an infinitely thin
perfectly edge-on disk) for the disk, with endpoints and amplitude as free parameters.
This simple model left significant residuals, so we added a two-dimensional
Gaussian smoothing kernel as another three free parameters to obtain a
substantially better fit (see Figure \ref{fig:contmodel_residuals}).

We determined that the disk is resolved in both
directions, with a scale height of 0.076\arcsec (31.5 AU) and a length of 0.223
\arcsec (92.5 AU), resulting in a radius $r_{disk}=46.3$ AU.  These measurements
are very close to those published by \citet{Plambeck2016a}, though their data
only marginally resolved the source at wavelengths 1 mm and shorter.

This simple model leaves a significant 2.5 mJy residual pointlike source at
J2000 05h35m14.5182s -05d22m30.6084s, which we measured by adding a point
source to the model in Figure \ref{fig:contmodel_residuals}.  This additional
source may be part of a flared or warped inner disk, a large companion, or part
of the inner outflow.  Could it also be part of an accretion flow?  It would be
worth monitoring this blob to see if it is in orbit or infalling or something
else.  {\color{red} If we decide we believe this source is real, we will add
a discussion section about it.}

The disk has a brightness temperature ranging from 200-500 K.  These measurements
agree well with the continuum model of \citet{Plambeck2016a}, who inferred
the presence of an optically thick $T=500$ K surface from the SED.

\subsection{Water Line}
The brightest and most interesting line is the \water $5_{5,0}-6_{4,3}$ line at
232.68670 GHz, with $E_U=3461.9$ K.  \citet{Hirota2012a} detected this line
in 2\arcsec resolution ALMA Science Verification data, but believed it to be
masing.  We report here that, because it is similar in morphology and
excitation level to the 336 GHz vibrationally excited water line reported in
\citet{Hirota2014a}, and it has a peak brightness temperature $\sim1000$ K, it
is most likely a thermal line.

The water line traces an X-shaped feature above and below the disk, closely
resembling the overall distribution of SiO masers.

While the continuum disk truncates at r=50 AU, the lines show emission
beyond this radius, with \water exhibiting emission out to $r\sim100$ AU
{\color{red} This is a coarse estimate, and the water probably only goes out to
$r>50$ AU above and below the disk}.

\subsection{Other lines}
Several unidentified lines exhibit emission at the outer edge of the continuum disk.
The peak signal from these lines appears within the $T_B\gtrsim75$ K contour
(Figure \ref{fig:U1peak}).
Their lack of association with the inner disk suggests that they trace the outer
surface of an optically thick disk.
If a molecule is at a similar temperature to the dust, but its line approaches
an optical depth near unity at a lower column density of \hh than the dust,
it should appear in emission.  These lines therefore appear to trace the disk
directly and provide the best direct tools for measuring the disk kinematics.

mJy \perbeam (15, 75, 150, 300, 450 K).

they exhibit no coincident emission.

\subsection{Kinematics: a Keplerian disk}
Following \citet{Seifried2016a}, we measure the outer edge of the detected
emission to define the rotation curve surrounding Source I.

Of the detected lines, only the \water line spans a significant range of
velocities as a function of radius; as shown in Figures \ref{fig:h2okepler},
there is \water emission spanning at least from radius 10 to 100 AU.  Many
other molecules, most of
which we have not been able to identify, span a range of 30-80 AU, while SiS
spans 30 AU to an unconstrained outer radius.  Because the water line,
which traces emission mostly above and below the disk, shows a good kinematic
match to the unknown lines that more directly trace the disk, we argue it is
a good tracer of the disk's kinematics.

We find that a 19 \msun edge-on Keplerian rotation curve fits the outer edge of
the \water line reasonably well, and is also an acceptable match to the outer
profiles of other lines.  A smaller mass, such as the 5-10 \msun suggested
previously \citep{Plambeck2016a,Hirota2014a}, is inconsistent with the data:
for such masses, emission is clearly detected outside of the Keplerian curve.
These lower masses are therefore excluded.

Red curves show the Keplerian velocity profile surrounding a 19 \msun
central source; green dotted curves show a Keplerian profile for a 10 \msun

The purple dashed lines show the full orbital path for radii of
10 and 100 AU, and indicate the approximate limits of the disk.
The left version is extracted from a range $\pm0.05\arcsec$ (50 AU)
around the fitted centerline of the continuum emission [actually, it's from
a drawn line right now], so it includes significant amounts of `superdisk'
emission.  The right version is extracted from a narrower $\pm0.01\arcsec$
range, less than a beam width, and shows the best approximation of the midplane
available.

There are two reasons our measurements differ from those of \citet{Plambeck2016a},
\citet{Hirota2014a}, and \citet{Matthews2010a}: first is our substantially better
spatial resolution, and second is the method we use to infer the mass from the
rotation curve.  Our method is motivated by the simulations of \citet{Seifried2016a},
who show that the centroid-based method used by the other authors (which they were forced
to use because of the lower resolution of previous data) systematically
underestimates the central source mass.

{\color{red} Note to coauthors:
What uncertainties are there in these measurements?
Do we need to account for turbulent line broadening?
\citet{Flaherty2017a} suggest that there is negligible turbulence in low-mass disks,
but what about Source I?

If there's no turbulence, and we assume $T\sim1000$ K, the
linewidth of \hh is 2.7 \kms, which is enough to lead us to overestimate the mass by a
non-negligible amount.  Do we need to correct for this by subtracting off (2.7 / 2) \kms
from the line extrema?  Or, do we assume that the molecules we are detecting have
much narrower thermal broadening because they come from massive molecules, e.g., \methanol,
such that the linewidths are $<1 \kms$?
}


\section{Discussion}
{\color{red} Note to coauthors: the discussion is a placeholder, but highlights
the key topics we are likely to discuss.  We'll expand on this further when
we are confident in the measurements.}
We measure a mass of XXX, which is higher than reported by Hirota, Matthews, etc.

Reasons:
\begin{itemize}
    \item1. Higher frequency (336 GHz, for example) is more optically thick, traces less
of the disk.
\item2. Method: Siefried showed that vel-of-highest-channel is better than centroid-based
approaches
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Is this disk consistent with the dynamical ejection model?}
\citet{Plambeck2016a} argue that both the mass of Source I and the presence of the disk
rule out the dynamical ejection model of \citet{Bally2011a}.  We show here that
the star is significantly more massive, but what about the disk?

First, we note that the disk truncates at $R<50$ AU.  At this radius, the
orbital timescale is $\sim100$ years, so gas at the disk's outer radius would
have had five dynamical times to relax into a circular disk configuration after the
explosive event.

\section{Other unidentified lines with interesting morphology}
In this section, we show two of the other unidentified lines that appear to trace
the disk.  These figures (\ref{fig:U4} and \ref{fig:U5}) show that the lines
are nearly absent from the continuum-bright disk, but are detected along the upper and
lower surfaces and at the extrema along the disk.  The associated position-velocity diagrams

\section{Methodological comparison}
To compare fairly with \citet{Plambeck2016a}, we also used the
centroid-velocity method.  In this approach, we fit two-dimensional Gaussian
profiles to each `blob' in each velocity channel in the PPV cubes of spectral
lines.  Unlike previous works, we have had to fit multiple Gaussians in several
channels, since we resolve the structure and see `blobs' both above and below
the disk.

Figure \ref{fig:velcen} shows the results of this analysis.  While the
lower-mass source agrees better with the tilt of the velocity curve, it fails
to reproduce the high observed maximum velocities.  Different inner-radius
cutoffs have an effect on the inner velocity profile slope similar to changing
the central mass, so it is likely that the disk parameters, rather than the
central source mass, dominate our uncertainties in this approach. 

Figure \ref{fig:massradiusdemo} demonstrates this effect: the inner slope of
a 5 \msun, $20 \mathrm{AU} < r < 50 \mathrm{AU}$ disk is indistinguishable
from a 20 \msun , $30 \mathrm{AU} < r < 80 \mathrm{AU}$ disk, though the latter
extends to higher velocity and radius.

from the line data (5:35:14.517965 -5:22:30.633931 ICRS; note that this is
different from the continuum-determined location).  Source I's position is
marked with a grey circle at the center.  The grey line indicates the disk
midplane as determined from the continuum modeling; it is notably offset from
the line positions.  The circles are colored by their velocity as indicated in
the right panel.  The right panel shows a position-velocity diagram of these
same centroids.  The dotted external curves show Keplerian velocity profiles
for a 5 (red), 10 (green), and 20 (blue) \msun central source.  The black
curves show the predicted centroid velocity profile of a 5 \msun (solid) and 20
\msun (dotted) edge-on disk with inner radius 20 AU and outer radius 50 AU.
Both models show clear discrepancies with the data, likely indicating that
the selected cutoff radii are incorrect.
