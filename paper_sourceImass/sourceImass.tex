\title{The Mass of Orion's Source I}
\begin{abstract}
   We resolve the disk around source I and measure the rotation curve.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Source I is the closest candidate forming high-mass ($M>8$ \msun) star, 
and as such is the most important protostar for testing basic theories
of how massive stars formed.  However, despite its relative proximity at
a mere 414 pc from the sun \citep{Menten2007a}, the mass of Source I
has been the subject of prolonged debate, with several estimates putting
its mass below the classic 8 \msun threshold for a single star to go supernova
\citep[][]{Heger2003}.
% \color{red} Should this citation be qualified?


Several attempts have been made to measure the mass of Orion Source I using the
rotation curve of various molecular lines:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \citet{Hirota2014a} observed vibrationally excited \water emission
        from the $v_2=0, 10_{2,9}-9_{3,6}$ and  $v_2=1, 5_{2,3}-6_{1,6}$ lines
        with $E_L=1846$ and 2939 K, respectively.  They imaged these lines
        with $0.40\arcsec\times0.34\arcsec$ resolution and made
        \textit{velocity centroid maps} of the position of peak intensity
        as a function of velocity to measure the rotationally supported
        mass in Source I.  They obtained a mass estimate of $5-7\msun$.
    \item \citet{Plambeck2016a} measured both the continuum SED and the rotation
        curve of gas around Source I.  They used a centroiding approach
        similar to \citet{Hirota2014a} to measure the rotation curve of
        SO, SiS, SiO, and CO and infer the source mass $M\sim5-7$ \msun.
    \item \citet{Matthews2010a} used 3D measurements of SiO maser velocities
        at 0.5 mas (0.2 AU) resolution along a `bridge' hovering just above and
        below the disk and an assumed radius $r\sim35$ AU  to infer a mass
        $M\approx8-10$ \msun.
\end{itemize}

Source I's mass is also closely tied to the origin of the Orion Outflow.
Several authors argue that Source I, BN, and Source N \citep[or, alternatively,
source X][]{Luhman2017a} were part of a single non-hierarchical multiple system
that underwent dynamical decay, and this decay somehow triggered the outflow
\citep{Bally2005a,Rodriguez2005a,Goddi2010a,Bally2011a,Bally2015a,Bally2017a}.  However, others have
noted that the lower masses inferred for Source I above are incompatible with
this scenario \citep{Chatterjee2012a,Farias2017a,Plambeck2016a}, which requires
a mass $M_{I} \gtrsim 15$ \msun.

\section{Observations}

At 1.3 mm in our Robust 0.5 image, the beam is $0.052\times0.030$ \arcsec at
PA$=-77.7\degrees$ ($21.8\times12.7$ AU), resulting in a 
conversion factor of 15000 K Jy$^{-1}$.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Continuum}
We detect the disk in the continuum at 3mm, 1mm, and 0.8mm, but we detect
spectral lines only from the surfaces above and below the continuum disk at 1
mm (Figure \ref{fig:continuum_data_B6} shows the 1 mm continuum).  The nondetection of
lines in the disk midplane is a strong indication that the continuum is
optically thick, as has previously been noted
\citep[e.g.][]{Plambeck2016a}.

We fit the highest-resolution 1.3 mm and 3.2 mm continuum image with a simple
model to determine the basic
observational structure.  We used a linear model (i.e., an infinitely thin
perfectly edge-on disk) for the disk, with endpoints and amplitude as free parameters.
This simple model left significant residuals, so we added a two-dimensional
Gaussian smoothing kernel as another three free parameters to obtain a
substantially better fit (see Figure \ref{fig:contmodel_residuals_B6}).

We determined that the disk is resolved in both
directions, with a scale height of 20-30 AU and a length of about
90 AU (see Table \ref{tab:continuum_fit_parameters}).  These measurements
are very close to those published by \citet{Plambeck2016a}, though their data
only marginally resolved the source at wavelengths 1 mm and shorter.

This simple model leaves a significant residual pointlike source near
the center of the disk, which we measured by adding a point
source to the model in Figure \ref{fig:contmodel_residuals_B6}.
This source is discussed further in Section \ref{sec:ptsrc}.

Table \ref{tab:continuum_fit_parameters} also includes measurements
of the total integrated intensity and the ratio of the point source to
the total.

{\color{red}We recover a total intensity of 240 mJy for the Source I disk
system when excluding baselines $<250$m, which is only $\sim70\%$ what
\citet{Plambeck2016a} reported.  We recover a higher integrated intensity of
420-450 mJy - higher than \citet{Plambeck2016a} - when using the robust 0.5 
or robust 2 images.

% source may be part of a flared or warped inner disk, a large companion, or part
% of the inner outflow.  Could it also be part of an accretion flow?  It would be
% worth monitoring this blob to see if it is in orbit or infalling or something
% else.  

The disk has a brightness temperature ranging from 200-500 K.  These measurements
agree well with the continuum model of \citet{Plambeck2016a}, who inferred
the presence of an optically thick $T=500$ K surface from the SED.
{\color{red} The region of the surrounding hot core that is in line with the
disk is slightly fainter than its surroundings, hinting that the disk
is shading the core from the central source and adding circumstantial
confirmation that the disk is optically thick and cooler than the central
source.}

\subsection{Water Line}
The brightest and most interesting line is the \water $5_{5,0}-6_{4,3}$ line at
232.68670 GHz, with $E_U=3461.9$ K.  \citet{Hirota2012a} detected this line
in 2\arcsec resolution ALMA Science Verification data, but believed it to be
masing.  We report here that, because it is similar in morphology and
excitation level to the 336 GHz vibrationally excited water line reported in
\citet{Hirota2014a}, and it has a peak brightness temperature $\sim1000$ K, it
is most likely a thermal line.

The water line traces an X-shaped feature above and below the disk, 
resembling the overall distribution of SiO masers but with a somewhat narrower
distribution.  Since the water is not directly aligned with the continuum
disk, it may not be a direct kinematic tracer of orbits within the disk,
but it is at least as good a tracer as SiO.  Because the water emission is
thermal, though, there are less extreme brightness fluctuations, allowing
us to fit an upper-envelope velocity curve in Section \ref{sec:kinematics}.

% While the continuum disk truncates at r=50 AU, the lines show emission
% beyond this radius, with \water exhibiting emission out to $r\sim100$ AU
% {\color{red} This is a coarse estimate, and the water probably only goes out to
% $r>50$ AU above and below the disk}.

\subsection{Other lines}
Several unidentified lines exhibit emission at the outer edge of the continuum disk.
The peak signal from these lines appears within the $T_B\gtrsim75$ K contour
(Figure \ref{fig:U1peak}).
Their lack of association with the inner disk suggests that they trace the outer
surface of an optically thick disk.
If a molecule is at a similar temperature to the dust, but its line approaches
an optical depth near unity at a lower column density of \hh than the dust,
it should appear in emission.  These lines therefore appear to trace the disk
directly and provide the best direct tools for measuring the disk kinematics.

mJy \perbeam (15, 75, 150, 300, 450 K).

they exhibit no coincident emission.
{\color{red} Note to coauthors: there is a slight difference in position between the
center of the continuum emission and the midpoint of the two line emission blobs.

analysis in the Appendices.}

\subsection{Kinematics: a Keplerian disk}
\label{sec:kinematics}
Following \citet{Seifried2016a}, we measure the outer edge of the detected
emission to define the rotation curve surrounding Source I.  In Appendix
\ref{appendix:centroids}, to facilitate direct comparison with previous works,
we use the centroid-of-velocity-channel approach that \citet{Seifried2016a}
advise against.

Of the detected lines, only the \water line spans a significant range of
velocities as a function of radius; as shown in Figures \ref{fig:h2okepler},
there is \water emission spanning at least from radius 10 to 100 AU.  Many
other molecules, most of
which we have not been able to identify, span a range of 30-80 AU, while SiS
spans 30 AU to an unconstrained outer radius.  Because the water line,
which traces emission mostly above and below the disk, shows a good kinematic
match to the unknown lines that more directly trace the disk, we argue it is
a good tracer of the disk's kinematics.

We find that a 19 \msun edge-on Keplerian rotation curve fits the outer edge of
the \water line reasonably well, and is also an acceptable match to the outer
profiles of other lines.  A smaller mass, such as the 5-10 \msun suggested
previously \citep{Plambeck2016a,Hirota2014a}, is inconsistent with the data:
for such masses, emission is clearly detected outside of the Keplerian curve.
These lower masses are therefore excluded.

10 and 100 AU, and indicate the approximate limits of the disk.
The left version is extracted from a range $\pm0.05\arcsec$ (50 AU)
around the fitted centerline of the continuum emission [actually, it's from
a drawn line right now], so it includes significant amounts of `superdisk'
emission.  The right version is extracted from a narrower $\pm0.01\arcsec$
range, less than a beam width, and shows the best approximation of the midplane
available.

identical data and \emph{should} be identical shapes.}

{fig:h2okepler}{1}{3.5in}


There are two reasons our measurements differ from those of \citet{Plambeck2016a},
\citet{Hirota2014a}, and \citet{Matthews2010a}: first is our substantially better
spatial resolution, and second is the method we use to infer the mass from the
rotation curve.  Our method is motivated by the simulations of \citet{Seifried2016a},
who show that the centroid-based method used by the other authors (which they were forced
to use because of the lower resolution of previous data) systematically
underestimates the central source mass.

{\color{red} Note to coauthors:
What uncertainties are there in these measurements?
Do we need to account for turbulent line broadening?
\citet{Flaherty2017a} suggest that there is negligible turbulence in low-mass disks,
but what about Source I?

If there's no turbulence, and we assume $T\sim1000$ K, the
linewidth of \hh is 2.7 \kms, which is enough to lead us to overestimate the mass by a
non-negligible amount.  Do we need to correct for this by subtracting off (2.7 / 2) \kms
from the line extrema?  Or, do we assume that the molecules we are detecting have
much narrower thermal broadening because they come from massive molecules, e.g., \methanol,
such that the linewidths are $<1 \kms$?
}


\section{Discussion}
{\color{red} Note to coauthors: the discussion is a placeholder, but highlights
the key topics we are likely to discuss.  We'll expand on this further when
we are confident in the measurements.}
We measure a mass of XXX, which is higher than reported by Hirota, Matthews, etc.

Reasons:
\begin{itemize}
    \item1. Higher frequency (336 GHz, for example) is more optically thick, traces less
of the disk.
\item2. Method: Siefried showed that vel-of-highest-channel is better than centroid-based
approaches
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The point source in the disk}
\label{sec:ptsrc}
We have clearly detected a compact source near the center of the disk
at both 3mm and 1mm.  The sources has a flux rising from 1 mm to 3 mm -
behavior inconsistent with a thermal source.  However, since the source
is nearly coincident with an edge-on disk that we show is optically
thick at 1 mm, it is likely that the source is thermal but is significantly
attenuated at 1 mm and seen clearly at 3 mm.

\citet{Reid2007a} used comparable-resolution 7 mm VLA data to infer
the presence of a 2.2 mJy source at the center of the Source I disk.
The pointsource-to-disk flux ratio at 7 mm was $\sim20\%$, substantially
higher than we observe at either 1 or 3 mm.  The dominance of the central
source at longer wavelengths and the shallow spectral index from 7 to 3 mm
($\alpha\approx0.7$) suggest that the disk is still somewhat optically
thick at 3 mm.

The central source has a surface temperature $T\geq1250$ K, the brightness
temperature of a 2.2 mJy source within a $41\times28$ milliarcsecond beam.  If
the source is a 5000 K blackbody \citep[e.g.,][]{Testi2010a}, it must have a
radius $R=7.5$ AU.  Such a gigantic star is implausible, as it would produce
a luminosity of 1.5\ee{6} \lsun, several orders of magnitude higher than
the total luminosity in the region.

{\color{red}
What is the emission mechanism from this central source?
It could simply be hot, optically thick dust that is partly obscured by the
cooler disk at higher frequencies.  The possible extension of this `source'
along the disk direction in Figure \ref{fig:contmodel_residuals_B6}
suggests that we may just be seeing the hot inner disk.
As pointed out by \citet{Plambeck2016a}, it is quite unlikely to be
free-free emission, since there are no detected recombination lines.
}

\subsection{Is this disk consistent with the dynamical ejection model?}
\citet{Plambeck2016a} argue that both the mass of Source I and the presence of the disk
rule out the dynamical ejection model of \citet{Bally2011a}.  We show here that
the star is significantly more massive, but what about the disk?

First, we note that the disk truncates at $R<50$ AU.  At this radius, the
orbital timescale is $\sim100$ years, so gas at the disk's outer radius would
have had five dynamical times to relax into a circular disk configuration after the
explosive event.

\paragraph{Discussion related to the dynamical decay scenario}
\citet{Farias2017a} report that, while any dynamical decay scenario
involving Sources I, X, and BN that can reproduce the observed 
proper motions are unlikely, they favor a higher mass ($M>14$ \msun).

\section{Other unidentified lines with interesting morphology}
In this section, we show two of the other unidentified lines that appear to trace
the disk.  These figures (\ref{fig:U4} and \ref{fig:U5}) show that the lines
are nearly absent from the continuum-bright disk, but are detected along the upper and
lower surfaces and at the extrema along the disk.  The associated position-velocity diagrams

\section{Methodological comparison}
\label{appendix:centroids}
To compare fairly with \citet{Plambeck2016a}, we also used the
centroid-velocity method.  In this approach, we fit two-dimensional Gaussian
profiles to each `blob' in each velocity channel in the PPV cubes of spectral
lines.  Unlike previous works, we have had to fit multiple Gaussians in several
channels, since we resolve the structure and see `blobs' both above and below
the disk.
Figures \ref{fig:velcen_U4}, \ref{fig:velcen_SiO}, and \ref{fig:velcen_H2O}
show the results of this analysis.

% {\color{red} Question to coauthors: How should I implement this modeling?
% My current implementation lives at
% \url{https://github.com/keflavich/Orion_ALMA_2016.1.00165.S/blob/master/analysis/edge_on_ring_velocity_model.py},
% and effectively assumes an infinitely small beam.  A larger effective beam will
% have some effect on the observed velocity profile; I believe it will weight
% toward higher velocities, therefore steepening the slope.  I don't incorporate
% line width at all in this analysis, but I can't convince myself it should have
% any effect under the assumption that the disk is symmetric and we are measuring
% centroids.}


We have modeled the velocity profile assuming an edge-on, uniform, optically
thin disk with a sharp central hole and outer truncation.  The
position-velocity curves derive with this approach are shown in the above
figures for a 14 \msun, $30 < R < 70$ AU model, and in \ref{fig:massradiusdemo}
for other masses and radii.  This model approach is the same used by
\citet{Plambeck2016a}.

We compared our data to the models adopted by \citet{Plambeck2016a},
specifically, the 5 and 10 \msun, $20 < R < 50$ AU models.  Neither of these
reproduce the position-velocity curves we have measured with our
higher-resolution data.  We were able to obtain a reasonable match
to the data with the 14 \msun, $30 < R < 70$ \msun model, but this model
may not represent a unique solution.

% While the
% lower-mass source agrees better with the tilt of the velocity curve, it fails
% to reproduce the high observed maximum velocities.

In the edge-on disk models, different inner-radius cutoffs have an effect on
the inner velocity profile slope similar to changing the central mass, so it is
likely that the disk parameters, rather than the central source mass, dominate
our uncertainties in this approach.  
Figure \ref{fig:massradiusdemo} demonstrates this effect: the inner slope of
a 5 \msun, $20 \mathrm{AU} < r < 50 \mathrm{AU}$ disk is indistinguishable
from a 20 \msun , $30 \mathrm{AU} < r < 80 \mathrm{AU}$ disk, though the latter
extends to higher velocity and radius.

The most important conclusion from this modeling is that the higher-resolution
data yield a higher mass than the original lower-resolution data, favoring
a central star with $M>10$ \msun.  However, the centroid-based approach
still appears consistent with a lower mass ($M\lesssim15\msun$) central star
than the \citet{Seifried2016a} upper-envelope fitting approach.  This remaining
ambiguity highlights the difficulty of direct mass inference from assumed
Keplerian velocity curves and the need for more sophisticated disk radiative
transfer models.
